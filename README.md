## Smartermail Installation for AlmaLinux

:Fire: This is an alternative installation guide for SmarterMail on Linux, specifically **AlmaLinux 10.x**.

In the wiki I show the installation, the provision of the proxy with **nginx** and the migration of the data from the Windows Server.

* I hope you might be able to use some of the ideas or approaches.
* This documentation supplements the SmarterTools manual and does not replace it.
